    **1. Composting**:
    - Convert kitchen scraps and yard waste into nutrient-rich compost for your garden.
    - Reduces methane emissions from landfills and enriches soil naturally.
    - **Tip**: Use a compost bin or pile in your backyard, and avoid composting meat or dairy to prevent odors.

    **2. Water Conservation**:
    - Fix leaky faucets and install water-saving fixtures (like low-flow showerheads).
    - Collect rainwater for gardening or outdoor cleaning tasks.
    - **Tip**: Run dishwashers and washing machines with full loads to maximize water efficiency.

    **3. Energy Efficiency**:
    - Replace traditional bulbs with LED or CFL lights, which use less energy and last longer.
    - Invest in energy-efficient appliances and unplug devices when not in use to reduce 'phantom' energy consumption.
    - **Tip**: Use a smart power strip to turn off multiple devices at once.

    **4. Sustainable Transportation**:
    - Opt for public transportation, carpool, or biking whenever possible.
    - Reduce your carbon footprint by driving less, planning routes efficiently, or even switching to electric vehicles.
    - **Tip**: For short trips, consider walking or cycling – it's healthier and eco-friendly!

    **5. Mindful Consumption**:
    - Buy products with minimal packaging and choose items made from recycled or sustainable materials.
    - Support brands and companies that prioritize sustainability and ethical practices.
    - **Tip**: Bring your own reusable bags, bottles, and containers to reduce single-use plastic waste.
