    **1. Composting**:
    - Convert kitchen scraps and yard waste into nutrient-rich compost for your garden.
    - Reduces methane emissions from landfills and enriches soil naturally.
    - **Tip**: Use a compost bin or pile in your backyard, and avoid composting meat or dairy to prevent odors.

    - Buy products with minimal packaging and choose items made from recycled or sustainable materials.

    - **Tip**: Bring your own reusable bags, bottles, and containers to reduce single-use plastic waste.
